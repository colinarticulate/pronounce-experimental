Colin system reports working for all frates with option -remove_silence as 'no'. It uses two different models:-hmm is from original pocketsphinx installation and -featparams from new xyz pocketsphinx installation.
He uses models with file sizes that don't match my current settings configured previously with articulate (art_db) settings.

1. Replace my models with that of Colins.
Outcome: frate=91 still doesnt work.I don't even get a log file.

2.Fix installation bug: MODELDIR is still pointing to /usr/local/share/pocketsphinx/model/
2.1. Uninstall both systems
2.2 install original pocketsphinx
2.3 install xyzpocketsphinx (fixing bug first)
Outcome: still persists
